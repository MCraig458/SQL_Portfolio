-- In this project, I will use a dataset containing Spotify data. 
-- First, I will create the table. 

CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,

-- Top 10 most danceable artists. 

SELECT artist_name, AVG(danceability)

-- Who are the top 10 artists based on popularity? 

SELECT DISTINCT artist_name, popularity, id

-- +++++ Why is Olivia Rodrigo appearing twice on this list?? 
-- +++++ I thought it could be a typo or extra characters in the CSV data, 
-- +++++ so first I added the ~id~ column to my query to identify which rows were appearing in the results.
-- +++++ Next I opened the file in Excel and used copy/paste to be certain 
-- +++++ every duplicate artist name would match exactly.
-- +++++ Dropped the table, Created the table, Imported the CSV data, Same result.  
-- +++++ Olivia Rodrigo (id 4, 1) appear in the Top 10 Artists by Popularity at #1 and #9.

-- What artist released the longest song?

-- Calculate the average popularity for the artists in the Spotify data table. 
-- Then, for every artist with an average popularity of 90 or above, show their name, 
-- their average popularity, and label them as a “Top Star”.
