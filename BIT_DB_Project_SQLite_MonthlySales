--In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

--1. How many orders were placed in January? 
SELECT COUNT(orderid) 
  FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
 WHERE length(orderid) = 6 AND 
       orderid <> 'Order ID';
       
-- 2. How many of the January orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT(product) 
  FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
 WHERE product = 'iPhone' AND 
       length(orderid) = 6 AND 
       orderid <> 'Order ID';
       
-- 3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT DISTINCT "acctnum"
  FROM BIT_DB.customers cust
       INNER JOIN
       BIT_DB.FebSales Feb ON cust.order_id = FEB.orderid
 WHERE length(orderid) = 6 AND 
       orderid <> 'Order ID';
       
-- 4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT DISTINCT product,
                MIN(price) 
  FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
 GROUP BY product,
          price
 ORDER BY price
 LIMIT 1;
 
-- 5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT SUM(quantity) * price AS revenue,
       product
  FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
 GROUP BY product;
 
-- 6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT SUM(Quantity),
       Product,
       SUM(Quantity) * price AS Revenue
  FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
 WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
 GROUP BY Product;
 
-- 7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT count(DISTINCT cust.acctnum),
       avg(quantity * price) 
  FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
       LEFT JOIN
       BIT_DB.customers cust ON FEB.orderid = cust.order_id

       orderid <> 'Order ID';

-- 1. Which locations in New York received at least 3 orders in January, and how many orders did they each receive?
SELECT DISTINCT location,
                COUNT(orderID)

       length(orderid) = 6 AND 
       orderid <> 'Order ID'
 GROUP BY location
HAVING COUNT(orderID) > 2;

-- 2. How many of each type of headphone were sold in February?
SELECT DISTINCT product,
                SUM(quantity) 
  FROM BIT_DB.FEBSales
 WHERE product LIKE '%head%' AND 
       length(orderid) = 6 AND 
       orderid <> 'Order ID'
 GROUP BY product;
 
-- 3. What was the average amount spent per account in February?
SELECT SUM(quantity * price) / COUNT(acctnum) 
  FROM BIT_DB.FEBSales AS Feb
       JOIN
       BIT_DB.customers AS cust ON Feb.orderID = cust.order_id

-- 4. What was the average quantity of products purchased per account in February? 
SELECT sum(Feb.quantity) / count(cust.acctnum)

       orderid <> 'Order ID';
       

-- 5. Which product brought in the most revenue in January and how much revenue did it bring in total?
SELECT product,
       sum(quantity * price) 
  FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
 GROUP BY product
 ORDER BY sum(quantity * price) DESC
 LIMIT 1;
